Tetris
======

This is my first year project on C programming language cource, but I use C++ as programming language in this project.

To run this project, you will need Windos XP operating system or any earlier 32 bit Windows operating system.

I use bgi graphics library for this project. So you need this installed in your computer.
It is also attached in the source named "GRAPHICS.H".

I open this source code using Creative Common Non-Commertial lisence. Everyone is free to use it for non-commertial purpose. 

Thanks.
